- Bun Package Manager

## Thought Process

1. Component Design:

   - The project was broken down into modular components for better maintainability.
   - Components were created for metrics, data visualizations, and the data table to separate concerns.

2. State Management:

   - Redux was used to manage the state of the sidebar and user information.
   - The dashboard pulls state information to determine layout adjustments and display personalized content.

3. Responsiveness:

   - Tailwind CSS was used to ensure that the dashboard is responsive across different devices.
   - Used ShadCN for better and responsive design.

4. Mock Data:

   - Mock data was used for charts and tables.

5. Performance Considerations:

   - Memoization and lazy loading were applied to improve performance where necessary.
   - State changes and layout adjustments are optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Trade-offs
- **Mock Data:** Instead of connecting to a real backend, mock data was used. But a delay was added to mimic an API fetch.
- **Chart Interactivity:** The chart interactions are limited to hover and click events, but more advanced interactions like zoom or data export could be added in the future.
- **Testing:** Limited unit testing was performed due to time constraints.
